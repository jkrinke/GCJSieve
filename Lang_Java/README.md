GCJ50 for Java
==============

This folder is for the Java subset of the Google Code Jam dataset.

Note that the created dataset is dependent on the compiler used to check wether a submission compiles.
Moreover, due to deprecation the generated subset may contain submissions that can no longer be compiled with newer Java compilers, for example, when deprecated APIs switch from generating warnings to errors.

For that reason, the compiler release target is set to Java 8.
