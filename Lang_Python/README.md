GCJSieve for Python
===================

This folder is for the Python subset of the Google Code Jam dataset.

Note that the created dataset is dependent on the compiler used to check wether a submission compiles.
Every submission is first compiled with Python-2.7 and if that fails, another attempt is made with Python-3.8.
